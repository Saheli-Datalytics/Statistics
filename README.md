This folder contains projects based on statistics. One project is based on Multiple linear regression, and other projects are based on time forecasting and logistic regression. 
The other project is based on a diabetes dataset, where logistic regression and statistical analysis are done to identify diabetic people using Python. 
The last project is based on temperature forecasting in Armagh based on monthly and yearly data. R is used where statistical analysis like the augmented Dickey-Fuller test, the Li Jung Box test, ARIMA, SARIMA, moving average, Exponential Smoothing, and Holt-Winters tests are done.
